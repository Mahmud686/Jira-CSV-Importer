# Jira Issue Uploader - README

## Overview
This Python script provides a GUI application for uploading and updating issues in Jira from a CSV file. It allows users to:
- Authenticate with Jira using an API token
- Select a Jira project
- Create new issues or update existing ones
- Handle Epics and their linkages
- View project components
- Process time tracking estimates

## Features

### Authentication
- Stores Jira credentials (email + API token) in `token.txt`
- First-time setup prompts for credentials if `token.txt` doesn't exist

### Project Selection
- Fetches all accessible Jira projects
- Presents them in a dropdown menu
- Remembers last used project via `project_key.txt`

### CSV Processing
- Reads CSV file path from `CSVFilePath.txt` (generated by VBA macro)
- Processes these columns:
  - Task-ID
  - Issue Type
  - Summary
  - Description
  - Epic Link
  - Original Estimate (in seconds)
  - Remaining Estimate (in seconds)
  - Components

### Issue Management
- Creates new issues if they don't exist
- Updates existing issues with options to:
  1. Update all issues automatically
  2. Update issues one-by-one with confirmation
- Handles Epic creation and linking
- Converts time estimates from seconds to hours

### Components View
- Displays all components available in the selected project

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
  - `requests` (install via `pip install requests`)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install requests`
3. Run the script: `python jira_uploader.py`

## Usage
1. First run will prompt for Jira credentials (email + API token)
2. Select a project from the dropdown
3. Choose to either:
   - Update all issues automatically
   - Update issues one-by-one with confirmation
4. View project components if needed
5. The script will process the CSV file specified in `CSVFilePath.txt`

## File Structure
- `token.txt` - Stores authentication credentials
- `project_key.txt` - Stores last used project key
- `CSVFilePath.txt` - Contains path to CSV file (generated by VBA macro)

## Notes
- Replace all instances of "your-jira-instance.atlassian.net" with your actual Jira instance URL
- The script expects the CSV file to be generated by a specific VBA macro
- Time estimates are converted from seconds to hours for Jira
